I am interested in the development of principled methods to quantify and evaluate epistemic uncertainty in machine learning models, with particular emphasis on calibration and robust evaluation protocols. Another aspect of my work is the proper disentanglement of aleatoric and epistemic components, aiming to provide clearer insights into the sources of a model's uncertainty.
