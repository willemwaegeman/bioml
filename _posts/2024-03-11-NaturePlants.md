BioML lab uses innovative scientific methods in the fight against illegal timber trade! By combining Gaussian processes and statistics, researchers, including dr. ir. Thomas Mortier and prof. dr. Willem Waegeman, were able to create a robust framework to verify the legality of wood. This not only allows verifying origin of wood, but also enables sustainable forest management. Their work has been published in the prestiguous journal [Nature Plants](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-024-01648-5) and played a pivotal role in a recent [Belgian investigation into Russian wood-based panel imports](https://www.tijd.be/politiek-economie/belgie/algemeen/illegaal-russisch-hout-onderschept-in-belgie/10530099.html).
