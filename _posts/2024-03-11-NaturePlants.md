BioML lab uses innovative scientific methods in the fight against illegal timber trade! By combining advanced methods, researchers, including dr. ir. Thomas Mortier and prof. dr. Willem Waegeman, are able to create robust models to verify the legality of wood. This not only allows verifying where the wood used comes from, but also enables sustainable forest management. Their work has been published in the prestiguous journal [Nature Plants](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41477-024-01648-5) and played a pivotal role in a recent [Belgian investigation into Russian wood-based panel imports](https://www.tijd.be/politiek-economie/belgie/algemeen/illegaal-russisch-hout-onderschept-in-belgie/10530099.html).
