In the first day of the [Northern Lights Deep Learning Conference](https://www.nldl.org/) at the Artic University of Norway, Willem Waegeman gave a tutorial on aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in statistics and machine learning. The tutorial covered the basics of uncertainty estimation, the difference between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty, and how to estimate these uncertainties in practice. The tutorial was well received by the audience and sparked interesting discussions on the topic.
