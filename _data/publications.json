In particular, this includes the importance of distinguishing between (at least) two different types of uncertainty, often referred to as aleatoric and epistemic.

We can identify single cells with an accuracy >90% for more than half of the communities consisting out of two bacterial populations. In order to assess to what extent an in silico community is representative for its synthetic counterpart, we created so-called abundance gradients, a combination of synthetic (i.e., in vitro) communities containing two bacterial populations in varying abundances. By showing that we are able to retrieve an abundance gradient using a combination of in silico communities and supervised machine learning techniques, we argue that in silico communities form a viable representation for synthetic bacterial communities, opening up new opportunities for the analysis of synthetic communities and bacterial flow cytometry data in general."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "jdjZppMAAAAJ:5ugPr518TE4C", "num_citations": 46, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=10400262560459503184,3541633113153911324", "cites_id": ["10400262560459503184", "3541633113153911324"], "pub_url": "https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0169754", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:ULb7HrInVZAJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2016": 2, "2017": 5, "2018": 6, "2019": 7, "2020": 5, "2021": 9, "2022": 7, "2023": 4}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "Label-free Raman characterization of bacteria calls for standardized procedures", "pub_year": 2018, "citation": "Journal of microbiological methods 151, 69-75, 2018", "author": "Cristina Garc\u00eda-Timermans and Peter Rubbens and Frederiek-Maarten Kerckhof and Benjamin Buysschaert and Dmitry Khalenkow and Willem Waegeman and Andre G Skirtach and Nico Boon", "journal": "Journal of microbiological methods", "volume": "151", "pages": "69-75", "publisher": "Elsevier", "abstract": "Raman spectroscopy has gained relevance in single-cell microbiology for its ability to detect bacterial (sub)populations in a non-destructive and label-free way.

Symptoms of Fusarium occur just after anthesis. The partly white and partly green heads are diagnostic for the disease in wheat (Figure 1C). The fungus also may infect the peduncle immediately below the head, causing a brown/purplish discoloration of the stem tissue. Additional indications of FHB infection are pink to salmon-orange spore masses of the fungus often seen on the infected spikelets and glumes. Infected kernels are shriveled, lightweight and dull grayish or pinkish. These kernels sometimes are called\" tomb-stones\" because of their chalky, lifeless appearance.

An emerging branch of the literature proposes the use of a second-order learner that provides predictions in terms of distributions on probability distributions. However, recent work has revealed serious theoretical shortcomings for second-order predictors based on loss minimisation. In this paper, we generalise these findings and prove a more fundamental result: There seems to be no loss function that provides an incentive for a second-order learner to faithfully represent its epistemic uncertainty in the same manner as proper scoring rules do for standard (first-order) learners.

However, the prediction of the 'long rains' season (March\u2013May) is particularly challenging for dynamical climate prediction models. Meanwhile, the potential for machine learning to improve seasonal precipitation forecasts in the region has yet to be uncovered. Here, we implement and evaluate four data-driven models for prediction of long rains rainfall: ridge and lasso linear regressions, random forests and a single-layer neural network. Predictors are based on SSTs, zonal winds, land state and climate indices, and the target variables are precipitation totals for each separate month (March, April and May) in the Horn of Africa drylands, with separate predictions made for lead-times of 1\u20133 months. Results reveal a tendency for overfitting when predictors are preselected based on correlations to the target variable over the entire historical period, a frequent practice in machine learning-based seasonal forecasting. Using this conventional approach, the data-driven methods \u2014 and particularly the lasso and ridge regressions \u2014 often outperform dynamical seasonal hindcasts. However, when the selection of predictors is done independently of both the train and test data, by performing this predictor selection within the cross-validation loop, the performance of all four data-driven models is poorer than that of the dynamical hindcasts.

However, due to the limited resolution of gene expression features, there is always uncertainty present in the label assignment. To enhance the reliability and robustness of annotation, most machine learning methods address this uncertainty by providing a full reject option, i.e. when the predicted confidence score of a cell type label falls below a user-defined threshold, no label is assigned and no prediction is made. As a better alternative, some methods deploy hierarchical models and consider a so-called partial rejection by returning internal nodes of the hierarchy as label assignment. However, because a detailed experimental analysis of various rejection approaches is missing in the literature, there is no consensus on best practices, superiority of certain methods, and potential drawbacks associated with rejection. We evaluate three annotation approaches (1) full rejection (2) partial rejection and (3) no rejection for both flat and hierarchical probabilistic classifiers. Our findings indicate that hierarchical classifiers are superior when rejection is applied, with partial rejection being the preferred rejection approach, as it preserves a significant amount of label information.

As performance measure, we use the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and its reformulation in terms of graphs. For the three-class case, this results in a new type of cycle transitivity for pairwise AUCs that can be verified by solving an integer quadratic program. Moreover, solving this integer quadratic program can be avoided, since its solution converges for an infinite data sample to a simple form, resulting in \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "jdjZppMAAAAJ:r0BpntZqJG4C", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6121820/", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Y2KcijDt-PkJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "An experimental comparison of cross-validation techniques for estimating the area under the ROC curve", "pub_year": 2011, "citation": "Computational Statistics & Data Analysis 55 (4), 1828-1844, 2011", "author": "Antti Airola and Tapio Pahikkala and Willem Waegeman and Bernard De Baets and Tapio Salakoski", "journal": "Computational Statistics & Data Analysis", "volume": "55", "number": "4", "pages": "1828-1844", "publisher": "North-Holland"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "jdjZppMAAAAJ:_FxGoFyzp5QC", "num_citations": 0, "cites_per_year": {}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "An analysis of explanatory variables affecting Fusarium infection and DON content in wheat", "pub_year": 2011, "citation": "63rd International symposium on Crop Protection 76 (4), 614-614, 2011", "author": "Sofie Landschoot and Willem Waegeman and Kris Audenaert and J Vandepitte and J Baeten and Bernard De Baets and Geert Haesaert", "conference": "63rd International symposium on Crop Protection", "volume": "76", "number": "4", "pages": "614-614", "abstract": "An analysis of explanatory variables affecting Fusarium infection and DON content in wheat \nUniversiteit Gent Add publications Lists Sign in Academic Bibliography Search 200 years of \npublications by Ghent University researchers.

Building further upon our previous work on this topic, we compare in this paper several decomposition methods that take into account specific properties about compositional data. We analyze three different types of kernel base learners for bivariate compositions, respectively based on maximum likelihood estimation, least-squares minimization and a label transformation. We also investigate two approaches for aggregating the bivariate predictions of these base learners into multivariate compositions, respectively based on a pairwise and a tree-based decomposition technique.

Due to the complex nature of FHB, such models typically consider several types of variables as input, including weather conditions, field-specific variables and crop characteristics. Yet a complete picture of all factors influencing FHB remains to be revealed. Instead of developing new prediction models, we present a thorough statistical analysis of weather, crop and field variables that might affect FHB, using an extensive and unique database of field observations covering eight different years and more than fifteen locations in Belgium. The results confirm several hypotheses that have recently been put forward by other authors without clear empirical evidence, but they also unravel new variables that play a more important role than expected beforehand, such as the underestimated effects of species interactions, preceding crop and early-stage weather conditions. An analysis of the species composition and DON level showed that the presence of F. graminearum and/or F. culmorum not automatically results in elevated DON levels. Conversely, wheat following maize in rotation leads to higher DON levels. Moreover, a correlation analysis revealed that weather conditions early in the growing season have a significant effect on DON accumulation.

Driven by a lot of potential applications in many domains, this paper presents various supervised algorithms for learning compositional data from other data sources, leading to a novel multi-label learning setting that bears strong similarities with multivariate regression, multi-label classification and multiclass classification. Building further upon our previous work on this topic, we compare in this paper several ensemble methods that take into account specific properties about compositional data. We analyze three different types of kernel base learners for bivariate compositions, respectively based on maximum likelihood estimation, leastsquares minimization and a label transformation. We also investigate two approaches for aggregating the bivariate predictions of these base learners into multivariate compositions, respectively based on a pairwise and a tree-based decomposition technique. The comparison of the algorithms is supported by empirical results on synthetic data and a realworld application in bioinformatics."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "jdjZppMAAAAJ:70eg2SAEIzsC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/1155411/file/2037066", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:iuk9yTZplzIJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "Learning partial ordinal class memberships in a proportional odds setting", "pub_year": 2010, "citation": "19th Conference on Machine Learning in the Benelux (Benelearn 2010), 2010", "author": "Jan Verwaeren and Willem Waegeman and Bernard De Baets", "conference": "19th Conference on Machine Learning in the Benelux (Benelearn 2010)", "publisher": "University Li\u00e9ge, DTAI research group", "abstract": "Jan Verwaeren Jan.

Intransitive relations cannot be modelled with existing machine learning methods like ranking models, because these models exhibit strong transitivity properties. More specifically, in a stochastic context, where often the reciprocity property characterizes probabilistic relations such as choice probabilities, it has been formally shown that ranking models always satisfy the well-known strong stochastic transitivity property. Given this limitation of ranking models, we present a new regularized least-squares algorithm capable of inferring intransitive reciprocal relations in problems where transitivity violations cannot be considered as noise. In this approach it is the kernel function that defines the transition from learning transitive to learning intransitive relations, and the Kronecker-product is introduced for representing the latter type of relations. In addition, we empirically demonstrate on a benchmark problem in game theory that our algorithm outperforms the traditional ranking approach."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "jdjZppMAAAAJ:mB3voiENLucC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/document?repid=rep1&type=pdf&doi=c4e9502d655a12078b3d8342e50dbb19d1144e3c#page=25", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KNi0q6lHcqwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "Machine learning algorithms for disease prediction in winter wheat", "pub_year": 2009, "citation": "18th Annual Belgian-Dutch conference on Machine Learning (Benelearn 09), 107-108, 2009", "author": "Dorien Colman and Willem Waegeman and Kris Audenaert and Bernard De Baets and Geert Haesaert", "conference": "18th Annual Belgian-Dutch conference on Machine Learning (Benelearn 09)", "pages": "107-108", "publisher": "Tilburg University.

Often referred to as learning fuzzy, mixed or partial memberships, this type of problems has been recently studied in fields like fuzzy set theory, statistics and machine learning, mainly from an unsupervised learning perspective. Given the interpretation of fuzzy class memberships in real-world applications, we present a supervised probabilistic approach. To this end, we show in particular how kernel-based logistic regression models can learn fuzzy memberships in an adequate manner, just by replacing zero-onecoded class labels by fuzzy labels in the likelihood function. Empirical results on several real-world data sets show that our approach leads to quasi-identical results but a tremendous gain in computational complexity, when compared with a naive algorithm that transforms each fuzzy class label into many zeroone coded class labels."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "jdjZppMAAAAJ:-f6ydRqryjwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/860684/file/860685", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:KWrof74fEaQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "Learning ordinal partial class memberships with kernel-based proportional odds models", "pub_year": 2009, "citation": "3rd International conference on Computational and Financial Econometrics \u2026, 2009", "author": "Willem Waegeman and Jan Verwaeren and Bernard De Baets", "conference": "3rd International conference on Computational and Financial Econometrics (CFE'09)", "abstract": "Learning ordinal partial class memberships with kernel-based proportional odds models \nUniversiteit Gent Add publications Lists Sign in Academic Bibliography Search 200 years of \npublications by Ghent University researchers.

When a classifier is uncertain about the class label for a test instance, it can predict a set of classes instead of a single class. In this paper, we focus on hierarchical multi-class classification problems, where valid sets (typically) correspond to internal nodes of the hierarchy. We argue that this is a very strong restriction, and we propose a relaxation by introducing the notion of representation complexity for a predicted set. In combination with probabilistic classifiers, this leads to a challenging inference problem for which specific combinatorial optimization algorithms are needed. We propose three methods and evaluate them on benchmark datasets: a na\u0131ve approach that is based on matrix-vector multiplication, a reformulation as a knapsack problem with conflict graph, and a recursive tree search method. Experimental results demonstrate that the last method is computationally more efficient than the other two approaches, due to a hierarchical factorization of the conditional class distribution."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "jdjZppMAAAAJ:6ZxmRoH8BuwC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://bnaic2022.uantwerpen.be/wp-content/uploads/BNAICBeNeLearn_2022_submission_7713.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:AArtumDvcxwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "Global hydro-climatic biomes via mulit-task learning Christina Papagiannopoulou, Diego G.

Social network sites are interested to predict whether two people know each other and e-commerce websites spend huge budgets to be able to recommend the right items to visitors. Also, in biology predicting interactions between different biomolecules is one of most basic steps in a systems biology approach. At a more abstract level, these different settings are identical. There are two sets of complex objects, with some kind of feature description. In addition, a relation matrix with at least some observed elements is available, denoting the interaction or relation between these objects. The problem boils down to constructing a model that is able to fill the missing values of this relation matrix.Our methods consist of a general framework for solving these types of problems based on a joint feature representation of pairs of objects by means of the Kronecker product pairwise kernel (KPPK). In this most general case the Kronecker is taken between the two object kernels. As such a pairwise kernel matrix is obtained which encodes the covariance between two pairs of objects. This pairwise kernel matrix can subsequently be used in any kernel-based learning algorithm, such as support vector machines or kernel ridge regression. By using kernels it is possible to work with complex structured objects, such as sequences, graphs or trees. Furthermore was shown that the KPPK can be used to model arbitrary relations and can be modified for specifically learning symmetric or reciprocal relations (Waegeman et al., 2012)."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "jdjZppMAAAAJ:EUQCXRtRnyEC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://benelearn2013.org/pdfs/paper_8.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:Bfa6GQVl2PQJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "Leren rangschikken: een ROC-gebaseerde grafentheoretische benadering Learning to Rank: a ROC-Based Graph-Theoretic Approach", "citation": "", "author": "Willem Waegeman", "abstract": "Ik herinner me nog levendig de periode mei-juli 2004, toen die vier jaar studeren eindelijk hun vruchten zouden afwerpen en leiden tot iets tastbaars: een diploma.

However, the prediction of the 'long rains' season (March\u2013May) is particularly challenging for dynamical climate prediction models. Meanwhile, the potential for machine learning to improve seasonal precipitation forecasts in the region has yet to be uncovered. Here, we implement and evaluate four data-driven models for prediction of long rains rainfall: ridge and lasso linear regressions, random forests and a single-layer neural network. Predictors are based on SSTs, zonal winds, land state and climate indices, and the target variables are precipitation totals for each separate month (March, April and May) in the Horn of Africa drylands, with separate predictions made for lead-times of 1\u20133 months. Results reveal a tendency for overfitting when predictors are preselected based on correlations to the target variable over the entire historical period, a frequent practice in machine learning-based seasonal forecasting. Using this conventional approach, the data-driven methods \u2014 and particularly the lasso and ridge regressions \u2014 often outperform dynamical seasonal hindcasts. However, when the selection of predictors is done independently of both the train and test data, by performing this predictor selection within the cross-validation loop, the performance of all four data-driven models is poorer than that of the dynamical hindcasts. These findings should not discourage future applications of machine learning for rainfall forecasting in the region. Yet, they should be seen as a note of caution to prevent optimistically biased \u2026"}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "jdjZppMAAAAJ:WJVC3Jt7v1AC", "num_citations": 5, "citedby_url": "/scholar?hl=en&cites=11281822897949458268", "cites_id": ["11281822897949458268"], "pub_url": "https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frwa.2022.1053020/full", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:XD8l6yYWkZwJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {"2023": 4, "2024": 1}}, {"container_type": "Publication", "source": "AUTHOR_PUBLICATION_ENTRY", "bib": {"title": "A framework for tracing timber following the Ukraine invasion", "pub_year": 2024, "citation": "Nature Plants, 1-12, 2024", "author": "Thomas Mortier and Jakub Truszkowski and Marigold Norman and Markus Boner and Bogdan Buliga and Caspar Chater and Henry Jennings and Jade Saunders and Rosie Sibley and Alexandre Antonelli and Willem Waegeman and Victor Deklerck", "journal": "Nature Plants", "pages": "1-12", "publisher": "Nature Publishing Group UK", "abstract": "Scientific testing including stable isotope ratio analysis (SIRA) and trace element analysis (TEA) is critical for establishing plant origin, tackling deforestation and enforcing economic sanctions.

Stifled by a historical lack of open data, machine learning research towards models specifically adapted to MALDI-TOF MS remains in its infancy. Given the growing complexity of available datasets (such as large-scale antimicrobial resistance prediction), a need for models that (1) are specifically designed for MALDI-TOF MS data, and (2) have high representational capacity, presents itself. Here, we introduce Maldi Transformer, an adaptation of the state-of-the-art transformer architecture to the MALDI-TOF mass spectral domain. We propose the first self-supervised pre-training technique adapted to mass spectra. The technique is based on shuffling peaks across spectra, and pre-training the transformer as a peak discriminator. Extensive benchmarks confirm the efficacy of this novel design. The final result is a model exhibiting state-of-the-art (or competitive) performance on downstream prediction tasks. In addition, we show that Maldi Transformer\u2019s identification of noisy spectra may be leveraged towards higher predictive performance."}, "filled": true, "author_pub_id": "jdjZppMAAAAJ:fFSKOagxvKUC", "num_citations": 0, "pub_url": "https://llms4science-community.github.io/papers/LLMs4Bio24_paper_9.pdf", "url_related_articles": "/scholar?oi=bibs&hl=en&q=related:sYUcn-QeVQMJ:scholar.google.com/", "cites_per_year": {}}]
