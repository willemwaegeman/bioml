# Machine Learning for the Life Sciences

The BIO-ML research group of Ghent University focusses on the development of machine learning methods for the life sciences. Specific research areas of interest are multi-target prediction, sequence learning, time series analysis, uncertainty quantification and probabilistic models. On this website you find more information about our group.

The BIOML research group at Ghent University developes new machine learning methods, and applies these methods in the life sciences. We regularly publish our fundamental work in top-tier machine learning conferences and journals, whereas more applied work is often published in other communities.
